# golang-microservices-cpu
Create a CPU out of Micro-Services. This is a project mostly to explore and demonstrate the utilization of Micro-Services Architecture in GoLang

There will be a set of services that communicate with each other. In addition, there will be an orchestrator to give full CPU functionality.
